SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS
App entry 'screen'
- app access behind more sophisticated authentication

User registration form
- mail verification: no mechanism to verify a mail address

New article creation form
- missing 'Cancel' button on new article creation
- missing info how to add tags to article (even grayed out)
- missing validation on fields length and content

Single article screen
- 'Edit Article' button at the bottom of the page is grayed out as if it was disabled
- @prev Edit/Delete Article section is duplicated - the one on the bottom should be removed
- Navigation to the previous page open 'Your Feed' regardless of the feed opened before
- 'Likes' count is not shown on the single article page
- Delete button doesn't trigger confirmation pop up

Feed page
- Pagination should be limited (for example to first, previous, next 3 pages and last)
- Popular Tags section should be limited to most popular tags and 'others'
- Empty tags should not be allowed
- When feed list is empty and resolution decreased (browser window is narrowed to <765px), tags' list take all available space

Navigation bar
- Missing Logout button/link (Profile Settings page is not suitable for that action)

Registration page
- Password requirements are not secure enough
- Inconsistent behavior: blank username -> sign up button active, but error on click. blank password -> sign up button inactive.

REST Api
- Missing endpoint for sign out
- Missing tags update endpoint or ability to update tags with article (or missing info about it in the documentation)

BUGS
1) Found during exploratory testing
- Missing src attribute for an image in the 'card-footer' div, on a single article page
- Tags are not being added to the article
- Article's abstract/description in not shown on the Single Article page
- Comments are not persisted, when added from the Single Article page
- 'Likes' are not persisted in the database
- Article with too long title can't be created - exceeding 2048 signs causes violation of http length limit
- Internal application errors are presented to the user not in the meaningful way (example @above)

2) Found during writing scenarios
- [critical] Token after logout action is still working (logout via UI, token used via REST Api)
- Slug is not changed once the article's title is changed (should be changed according to the documentation)
- Once an article is deleted, moving back to previous page (for example profile) results in 404 returned in a json. Only navigation to the main page helps.

3) Found during automation


NOTES
- Data testing should not be done on the UI, thus there ae no such tests
- Tests are small as possible to give a quick feedback on what is broken (if something is)
- Areas of my choice are the ones, which are critical for the application to be functional: CRUD on the articles and user registration/login, however due to 'social' function of AUT, I did also consider creating tests for likes, favorites and comments.
